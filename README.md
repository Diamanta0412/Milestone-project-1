## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the gym.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to sign up, log in.
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials with people whom are happy to go to the gym. I also want to locate their social media links to see their followings on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find information about new facilities added.
        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to easily get back on track and not lose time on unexpected things.
        3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find  easily their login page and not scroll infinitely to get to the desired content.

    -   #### Frequent User Goals
        1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added classes, programs, new personnel (Feature needs to be added).
        2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any social posts.
        3. As a Frequent User, I want to sign up for the Newsletter so that I am emailed any offers.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours are: #4d676c and white, along with yellow, red, and black.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Roboto and Poppins fonts are some of the main fonts used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. They are used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic as gym beginner or returning customer.

## Deployment and local deployment
## GitHub Pages
GitHub Pages has been used to deploy live version of the website.

Log in to GitHub and locate  [GitHub Repository:](https://github.com/Diamanta0412/Milestone-project-1)
On the navigation bar locate "Settings" button on the menu.
In the"Code and Automotation" category on the left, find the "Pages" button.
Find the "Source" section and change the button that says "none" to "deploy from a branch" and save.
Below this, find the "Branch" section and change from "none" to "main" then make sure the next button is on "root" and save.
The page should automatically refresh, if not refresh it manually.
Scroll back to locate the now-published site link in the "GitHub Pages" section.

## Forking the GitHub Repository
By forking the repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and change without affecting the original repository by using these steps:

Log in to GitHub and locate [GitHub Repository:](https://github.com/Diamanta0412/Milestone-project-1)o
At the top of the Repository, under the main navigation, find the "Fork" button.
Now you there should be a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

## Local Clone
Log in to GitHub and locate [GitHub Repository:](https://github.com/Diamanta0412/Milestone-project-1)
Under the repository name press "Clone or Download"
Click on the code button, select clone with HTTPS, SSH or GitHub CLI and copy the link shown.
Open Git Bash
Change the current working directory to the location where you would like the cloned directory to be made.
Type 'git clone' and then paste the URL copied in the step 3.
Press Enter and your local clone should be created.
